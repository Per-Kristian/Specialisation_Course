abstract="The study presented in the article focuses on keystroke dynamics analysisKeystroke dynamics          analysis         applied to recognize emotional states and to authenticate users. An overview of some studies and applications in these areas is presented. Then, an experiment is described, i.e. the way of collecting dataBehavioural          data        , extracting featuresKeystroke dynamics          features        , training classifiers and finding out the most appropriate feature subsets. The results show that it is difficult to indicate a universal sets of features for the defined tasks and the best idea is to individually adapt models to users.",
